    "Ans- Examples of when to use a `for` loop and a `while` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case: Known Number of Iterations**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is typically used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate. It's well-suited for situations where you have a collection or a range of values to iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop will iterate five times, printing the numbers 1 through 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case: Unknown Number of Iterations**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance, and the loop continues as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Summing numbers until a threshold is reached**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "num = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while total < 10:\n",
    "    total += num\n",
    "    num += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Sum:\", total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the loop continues to add numbers to the `total` variable until it reaches or exceeds 10. The number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing between For and While:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a `for` loop when you know the number of iterations beforehand and you want to iterate over a sequence or a range.\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop when you need to iterate until a certain condition is met and the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that using the appropriate loop depends on the specific requirements of your task."

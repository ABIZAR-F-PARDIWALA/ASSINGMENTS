    "OOP is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects, which have both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. \n",
    "It defines a set of attributes and methods that objects of the class will have. \n",
    "Think of a class as a generalized description of a category of objects. \n",
    "It encapsulates the common properties and behaviors that its objects share. \n",
    "Classes provide a way to structure code by promoting modularity, encapsulation, and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. \n",
    "It is a concrete representation of the class, with its own set of specific values for attributes. \n",
    "Objects are created from classes and can interact with each other through their methods. \n",
    "Each object has its own state, which is determined by the values of its attributes at a given moment. \n",
    "Objects provide a way to work with the specific, individual instances of a class.\"\"\"\n",

    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), self is a convention used to represent the instance of the class. It is the first parameter in the method definitions within a class and refers to the instance of the class itself. In Python, the use of self is essential for distinguishing between instance variables and local variables within the scope of a class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instance Reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "self is a reference to the instance of the class. It allows you to access and modify the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) of the object within the class.\n",
    "Without self, there would be ambiguity in the scope, and the interpreter wouldn't know whether you're referring to a local variable or an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a method on an object, self is automatically passed as the first parameter to that method. This allows the method to operate on the specific instance of the class.\n",
    "It enables the method to access and manipulate the attributes of the object to which it belongs."

    "\"\"\"Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). \n",
    "This promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance:\n",

    "   - In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one superclass.\n",

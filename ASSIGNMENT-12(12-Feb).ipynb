    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When a Python script encounters an error that it cannot handle, it raises an exception. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as invalid user input, file not found, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief comparison between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exceptions:**\n",
    "   - Occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "   - Typically caused by conditions like invalid user input, trying to access a non-existent file, division by zero, etc.\n",
    "   - Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors.\n",
    "   - Examples of exceptions include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
    "   - Detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing (compilation) phase before the code is executed.\n",
    "   - Occur due to violations of the language syntax rules, such as missing colons, unmatched parentheses, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "   - Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "   - Examples of syntax errors include missing colon at the end of a `def` or `class` statement, misspelled keywords, unmatched parentheses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during program execution when something unexpected happens, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before execution due to violations of language syntax rules."

    "1. We define a `divide` function that attempts to divide two numbers.\n",
    "2. Inside the `divide` function, we use a try-except block to catch `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "3. If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, we log the exception using the logging module.\n",
    "4. In the `main` function, we call the `divide` function with arguments that will trigger a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "5. Since we don't have an explicit try-except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` in the `main` function, it will propagate up to the top-level.\n",
    "6. However, since we've configured the logging module to log errors to a file (`error.log`), the exception information will be logged before the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even though the exception isn't handled in the `main` function, we still have a record of it in the log file, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding what went wrong in the program."

    "4. If the `divide` function returns a non-`None` result, we print the result. Otherwise, we print an error message indicating that an error occurred while dividing and instruct to check the error log for details.\n",
    "5. If any other exception occurs within the `main` function, it will be caught by the outer `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
